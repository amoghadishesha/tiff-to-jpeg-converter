#tiff-to-jpeg-converter
Simple code to convert multiple tiff files to jpeg

Code takes a folder (can contain multiple subfolders) and converts all tiff files to jpeg. The code saves the new jpeg files in a different folder of your choice

If the tiff images are stored like MAINFOLDER/A /file1.tiff , file2.tiff 

you can choose MAINFOLDER as your output folder in which case, subfolder 'A' will now have both tiff and jpeg files

if you choose ALTERNATEFOLDER as your ouput folder, you will have to create subfolders of the same names 'A' ...in the ALTERNATEFOLDER before running the code.

[NOTE: Subfolders of the same names have to be created in advance in the output folder]
